## 📍About
- ### 📋Sudoku is based on standard rules, when generating a field, from 40 to 64 cells are deleted, Sudoku with deleted cells is checked for solvability (there should not be more than 1 filling options)
- ### 💻The algorithms for generating Sudoku, deleting cells, and checking the number of solutions are written in python and integrated using chaquopy
- ### 😇This is my first more or less serious application, I will be glad to receive adequate criticism and open to suggestions
